## About

The tic-tac-toe application accompanies an online tutorial for building object-oriented games with Ruby.  Here is a link to the online tutorial: http://wp.me/p3sWrq-3P

I plan to create a pre work code quiz for this game on my website: http://www.codequizzes.com/

If you have any questions or comments on the application, please feel free to send me a pull request or an email.
