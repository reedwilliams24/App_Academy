We collect a $5,000 refundable deposit, of
which an initial $1,250 is due when you accept our offer. The balance
of the deposit is due 21 days before your first day of the program.

We collect a deposit for a few reasons. Foremost, we need to get an
accurate headcount of who will be attending; your spot is not reserved
until we receive the initial $1,250 deposit payment. Next, we take the
deposit as security toward the placement payment fee. If you owe us any
fee after the program, we apply your deposit toward the fee; otherwise
we refund it.

Please see the deposit agreement (attached to your acceptance email) for
more details.

Please transfer your initial, $1,250 deposit through PayPal; our
account is contact@appacademy.io. Please be sure not to transfer the
deposit as a personal payment, but instead as a payment for goods and
services.

The final payment of $3,750 is due 3
weeks before your cycle begins and must be received by that date to
avoid losing your spot in the class and your initial $1,250 deposit.
