# Deposit Agreement

This agreement is between App Academy ("We") and the Applicant ("You")
and sets out the requirements for your program deposit.

App Academy collects a $5,000 program deposit.
$1,250 is due when you accept our offer. When we receive this initial
deposit, we will reserve a place for you in the program. Your place in
the program is not reserved unless and until we receive the $1,250
deposit.

The balance of $3,750 is due 21 days
before your cycle begins. If you do not make this second deposit
payment when due, you will be considered to have dropped out of the
program. If we do not receive the $3,750 deposit balance, we will have to
keep, and cannot refund, your initial deposit of $1,250. The reason
that we have to do this is that a place in the program was held for
you after the initial deposit and we may not be able to fill it with
someone else afterwards.

## Program Rules

The success of the App Academy program depends upon a code of conduct.
Please see the program rules document for a description of the course
rules. The reason that we have to enforce these rules this is that (1)
we have to ensure that attendees meet their obligations for the program
to succeed for everyone else; and (2) an attendees who refuses to meet
his/her obligations is taking up a place in program. Students may be
dismissed from the program in accordance with the procedures laid out in
the course rules document.

## Forfeiture of Deposit

If you do not attend (for whatever reason), drop out of the program, or,
in accordance with program rules, App Academy dismisses you from the
program, App Academy keeps and will not refund your deposit.

## Deposit Refund

The deposit will be refunded and mailed to you within 365 days of the
cycle's end date.

If, in accordance with your placement fee contract, you owe us a job
placement fee within this period, your deposit will be applied toward
your placement fee.
